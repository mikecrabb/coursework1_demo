    <h1>Artemis 1</h1>

<p>Artemis 1, officially Artemis I,[6] is an ongoing uncrewed Moon-orbiting mission and the first major spaceflight of NASA's Artemis program. It is the first integrated flight test of the Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System rocket.[note 1] Artemis 1 was successfully launched from Kennedy Space Center on November 16, 2022, at 06:47:44 UTC (01:47:44 EST).[7][2][8][9] Its main objective is to test the Orion spacecraft, especially its heat shield,[10] in preparation for subsequent Artemis missions. These missions will seek to reestablish a human presence on the Moon and demonstrate technologies and business approaches needed for future scientific studies, including exploration of Mars.[11]</p> 

<p> Formerly known as Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1),[12] the mission was given its current name following the creation of the Artemis program. The mission lifted off from Launch Complex 39B at the Kennedy Space Center aboard the Space Launch System rocket. The Orion spacecraft has been launched on a mission of 25 days.[13] After reaching Earth orbit and performing a trans-lunar injection (burn to the Moon), the mission deployed ten CubeSat satellites. The Orion spacecraft has completed one flyby of the Moon, on November 21, and will enter a distant retrograde orbit for six days with a planned second flyby on November 25.[14] The Orion spacecraft will then return and reenter the Earth's atmosphere with the protection of its heat shield and splash down in the Pacific Ocean. The mission aims to certify Orion and the Space Launch System for crewed flights beginning with Artemis 2.[15] After the Artemis 1 mission, Artemis 2 is scheduled to perform a crewed lunar flyby and Artemis 3 a crewed lunar landing, five decades after the last lunar Apollo mission.</p>

<p> The Orion spacecraft for Artemis 1 was stacked on October 20, 2021,[16] marking the first time a super-heavy-lift vehicle has been stacked inside NASA's Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) since the final Saturn V in 1973. On August 17, 2022, the fully stacked vehicle was rolled out for launch after a series of delays caused by difficulties in pre-flight testing. The first two launch attempts were canceled due to a faulty engine temperature reading on August 29, 2022, and a hydrogen leak during fueling on September 3, 2022.[17]</p>
